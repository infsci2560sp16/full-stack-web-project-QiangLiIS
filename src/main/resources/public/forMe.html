				<h3>What is the proposed name for your Web application?</h3>
				<p>Online Bookstore.<br/>
				Many books will be sold in this online bookstore. Users can search for books by book name or book category.<br/>This bookstore has two authorities, one for customers, on for the manager.
				Customers can search for books and choose whether to buy them. <br/>Manager can update product data. The manager can be called as the owner of this online bookstore.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Who is the target audience?</h3>
				<p>The target audience is those who love reading and those who need specific materials to help them finish their tasks. It is also possible that there are some people tending to buy books as the gift.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>What problem is it intended to solve for the target audience?</h3>
				<p>The problems that can be solve by this online bookstore are listed below:<br/>
				1.	It can save users much time to buy books online. The user can buy what they want with a computer or phone, rather than go to physical stores. And they can easily find the book by the book name or book category. However, if they are in a physical bookstore, it would be hard to find the book. Because there are so many books in one category, and so many editions of one book name. It is time consuming compared with online search.<br/>
				2.	The comment of each book that was posted by previous purchasers can be viewed as the reference for current users. The users can determine whether the book is valuable to buy.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>How will it meet the minimum project requirements?</h3>
				<p>For this web application, when the user asks this website, he/she needs to login in with his/her personal account. If he/she does not have personal account yet, he/she need to register for it firstly. For every time registration, this customer information will be saved into the database. Of course, the customer can login successfully because his information has already been in the database.</p>
				<p>The manager can delete accounts by removing the account information from the database.
				The manager can also update data. For example, he can add stock number when there is not enough books in the stock. He also can change selling price.</p>
				<p>There is one special situation. If one kind of book’s sale is not good and do not make profit, the manager can remove this kind of book from bookstore. This book will not be shown on this website.</p>
				<p>Ajax can be used to meet all minimum requirements. For example, if there are many books in one category, it is not reasonable to show all of them. The Ajax can solve it. We can set a more button which can be used to show the rest of books.  The deletion of one book by the manager, that I have mentioned above, is also the application of Ajax.</p>
				<br/>
				<h3>Why is your proposed Web application unique or creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements?</h3>
				<p>There are some aspects to prove that my web application is creative: <hr/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				1.	This web application is real-time. The data will be updated day by day.<hr/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				2.	This web application has product comments from previous purchasers, which is unique and helpful to attract more customers.<hr/>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				3.	The web filter. If customer choose to show on kind books, the other kinds books will not be shown.
